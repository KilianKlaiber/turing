I failed a coding test for turing.com because I had to use an IDE, which would not let me test the code and return error messages. Therefore, I had to write the whole thing without a single intermediate test and hope to identify all the mistakes without any kind of error messages in the ide. Thus, I failed. Therefore, I chose to write a solution to the challenge in python using VSCode without using any LLMS. I merely looked up the remove method. 

I am publishing this in order to show that I can easily solve these kind of problems in a decent amount of time given a standard IDE.

This was the challenge according to my recollection:

Permutation = List of distinct positive numbers from 1 to N

Operation: Incrementing or decrementing a number by 1

Challenge: Detect the number of operations for turning a list of integers into a permutation
